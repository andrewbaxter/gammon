    <h1>Gammon Stand API</h1>
    <a href="index_en.html">Back</a>
    <p>
      This is the API games use to talk to the arcade, to do things like accept
      tokens and get user info.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>This is an HTTP (no S) API to <code>http://127.0.0.1:42243</code></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          All requests are <code>POST</code> with a JSON payload, and the
          response is a JSON payload as well
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          At the moment there are no error responses - if there's an issue I can
          check logs, but in normal operation from the game perspective it's
          fine to assume these calls will always work
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Responses may have additional properties for features in testing.
          Please ignore them until they are documented.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Coin acceptance API</h2>
    <p>Coins/tokens are also referred to as payments here.</p>
    <p>
      There are no actual coins/tokens - everything is done via NFC cards, but
      anyway this API serves the general purpose of "accepting coins".
    </p>

    <h3><code>{"v1": { "ask_payment": { ... } } }</code></h3>
    <p>This does several things:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Makes the card reader start accepting tokens, if it isn't already</p>
      </li>
      <li><p>If no token has been accepted, returns an empty response</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If a token has been accepted, reserves that token (so future calls
          don't return the same token) and
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><p>Returns the reservation ID</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      You're expected to repeatedly call this method (several times a second is
      fine) as long as you need a token, until you receive a token.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first time you call this method it'll likely return no payment
      (token), just initialize the card reader.
    </p>
    <p>
      If this method isn't called for a few seconds it stops accepting tokens.
    </p>
    <h4>Request structure</h4>
    <pre class="code">
{ "v1": { "ask_payment": {
    "client_payment_id": {
      "game_id": "my_game",
      "id": "payment123"
    }
} } }</pre
    >
    <p>
      <code>client_payment_id</code> is a unique ID for the payment (an
      idempotency token) composed of your game ID and a unique portion you
      generate as you see fit. Basically, after a payment is made for a
      <code>client_payment_id</code>, all requests for that
      <code>client_payment_id</code> will return the same data and no further
      tokens will be accepted. Use different <code>client_payment_ids</code> to
      accept multiple coins. You can use a random number or the current
      timestamp if you don't need this functionality.
    </p>
    <p>
      A committed payment will be recorded to the game in the
      <code>client_payment_id</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only one token can be requested at a time (there's only one reader).
      Making requests with a different <code>client_payment_id</code>s before a
      token is accepted will replace the previous request.
    </p>
    <h4>Success response, no token</h4>
    <pre class="code">
{ "ok": {
    "payment": null
} }
    </pre>
    <h4>Success response, token reserved</h4>
    <pre class="code">
{ "ok": {
    "payment": {
        "client_payment_id": {
          "game_id": "my_game",
          "id": "payment123"
        }
    }
} }
    </pre>
    <p><code>id</code> is the reservation ID, used by other calls.</p>
    <h3><code>{"v1": { "release_payment": { ... } } }</code></h3>
    <p>
      This releases a payment reservation. For instance, if a player that tapped
      in used the wrong card, or they decide they don't want to play before the
      game starts. This functionality is optional but may make for a better
      player experience.
    </p>
    <h4>Request structure</h4>
    <pre class="code">
{ "v1": { "release_payment": {
    "client_payment_id": {
      "game_id": "my_game",
      "id": "payment123"
    }
} } }</pre
    >
    <h4>Success response</h4>
    <pre class="code">
{ "ok": null }
    </pre>
    <h3><code>{"v1": { "commit_clear_payments": { ... } } }</code></h3>
    <p>
      When player selection is complete and no further changes can be made, call
      this to record the payment to the game. If any token reservations were
      lost (e.g. due to bugs), this call will also release them, and can be used
      to clear all reservations by sending the request with no "commit"
      reservations listed.
    </p>
