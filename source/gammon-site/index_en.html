    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This is a project to create a space for people to play, talk about, and
      watch others play indie games over coffee and food. Unlike traditional
      arcades which are loud, unaccommodating, and cater mainly to nostalgic or
      hardcore gamers, this will be a relaxing space that anyone with an
      interest in games can enjoy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The space will also host challenges, tournaments, and other game-related
      events.
    </p>
    <a id="state"></a>
    <h2>Current state</h2>
    <p>
      The game stand software is finished and Gammon is now in the business
      planning and preparation stages, with a goal of opening early 2025.
    </p>
    <a id="system"></a>
    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><p>A customer enters the store</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>
          They order at the counter. Each menu item includes 1 or more "play
          tokens". The clerk charges an NFC card with their tokens and gives it
          to the customer to use while in the store.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          While the customer waits for their order they can start playing games
          or watch others play (or demo videos) on the big screen.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If the customer gets tired of playing games, they can order a drink
          and take a break to watch others.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The store staff will help players play games and find other players for
      multiplayer games.
    </p>
    <a id="benefits"></a>
    <h2>Benefits for developers</h2>
    <p>
      For indie developers, there are a lot of benefits to having a game in the
      arcade. In no particular order:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          It's an additional source of revenue - aside from a small amount of
          work adapting the game for the arcade there's no costs.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          It provides exposure - while in the arcade, other players will see it
          being played which will build interest.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If someone enjoys the game at the arcade, they may decide to purchase
          it themselves.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Multiplayer games have limited lifespans due to needing an active
          player pool. But at the arcade there's an always-available pool of
          players (other customers).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Home gaming tends to favor long-form games with tens of hours of
          content, but a game with only 5 or 10 minutes of content is viable in
          an arcade setting.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The arcade provides a way to do limited early or demo releases and
          gather feedback.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The arcade is a great location to hold release events, tournaments,
          and other promotional activities.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <a id="games"></a>
    <h2>What sorts of games?</h2>
    <p>
      We'd love to have games that are easy to pick up and where an average play
      lasts around 5 minutes. The games can be single- or 2-player, or possibly
      allow local multiplayer.
    </p>
    <p>For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Traditional arcade games</p></li>
      <li><p>Racing games</p></li>
      <li><p>Sports games</p></li>
      <li><p>Fighting games</p></li>
      <li><p>Boss rush games</p></li>
      <li><p>Puzzle games</p></li>
      <li><p>Game-jam games or experimental games</p></li>
      <li><p>Game demos - a self-contained segment of a larger game</p></li>
      <li><p>Short narrative games</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A longer game that has many stages could be modified so that a single play
      is a single level, with a level-select screen.
    </p>
    <a id="adapting"></a>
    <h2>Preparing a game</h2>
    <p>
      Basically, games must move to the action as directly as possible (i.e. not
      have an intro/main menu/settings/tutorial/pause screen) and must accept
      tokens.
    </p>
    <p>There are two approaches to accepting tokens:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Gammon</em> handles payment and player select - this is the
          easiest option.
        </p>
        <p>
          The game can define the minimum and maximum number of players in a
          manifest file. The Gammon software will handle player selection and
          token payments. Once players and payments are selected, the game will
          be launched which can move immediately to gameplay.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The <em>game</em> handles payment and player select - this is the most
          flexible option.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gammon has a simple <a href="./api_en.html">HTTP API</a> for
          requesting and accepting play tokens. When a player selects the game,
          the game will be immediately launched. The game is responsible for
          allowing players to join and receive tokens via the HTTP API.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the most flexible option, allowing a custom player-select
          screen and advanced payment mechanics, like paying to revive after
          failure or for in-game boosts. It also makes repeated plays of the
          same game faster since there's no need to re-start the game
          executable.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

      I'm a software developer who's been living in Japan (in the Tokyo area)
      for 13 years. I love indie games and thought by starting a cafe like this
      I could get more involved in the community and create a great place to
      hang out.
